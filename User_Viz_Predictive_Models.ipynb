    "# Visualizing Predictive Models for Users\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to `Heart AI`, the latest and greatest dating app start-up. We're building a machine learning model to predict which user to match with which other user in speed dating events. We've gathered some existing data from a few in-person speed dating events, in which participants record their hobbies, demographic details, and level of interest in other participants they've met. Before we engineer the back-end, we'd like you, our resident Human-AI Interaction expert, to implement a few sample visualizations so we know what features to support.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Data \n",
    "`dates.csv` contains 8,378 entries from our pilot test data at heterosexual speed dating events at Columbia University from 2002-2004. In these events, each participant met each of all opposite-gender participants for four minutes. The number of speed dates dates varied by the event, on average there were 15, but it could be as few as 5 or as many as 22. Afterward, each participant was asked if they would like to meet any of their speed dating partners again. They also provided ratings on six **attributes** about each speed date:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Attractiveness\n",
    "- Sincerity\n",
    "- Intelligence\n",
    "- Fun\n",

    "The dataset also includes varying participants' perspectives on those attributes, along with other demographic information and hobbies as described below. \n",
