# Assignment #3 Setup Instructions

## Step #1 Ensure you have all programming modules
_If you completed Assignment 1 with the same machine, then you've already done this step!_

Install Anaconda Python 3.6 (or greater). [https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) You'll need Jupyter Notebook, pandas, and matplotlib, at the very least.

## Step #2 Download homework files
Download the `ipynb` notebook file in this repository as well as `data.zip`. Place both of these files into a well-named folder on your computer, and click on the zip file to unzip the data folder. Rename the `.ipynb` file to `[yourunix]_haii20a[assignmentnumber].ipynb`, e.g., `ikh1_haii20a3.ipynb`. You will submit this file to Glow when completed.

## Step #3 (Terminal Option)
In your terminal, navigate to your homework folder and run `jupyter notebook .` to start the notebook. A notebook session should open up in your browser.

## Step #3 (Graphical User Interface Option)
Once Anaconda is installed on your machine, open an application called Anaconda-Navigator. On the main page, click the 'launch' button on the Jupyter Notebook tile. A notebook session should open up in your browser.

On Windows, you will do [something like this](https://pythonforundergradengineers.com/opening-a-jupyter-notebook-on-windows.html) by running the 'Anaconda Prompt' that comes with the Anaconda distribution.

## Step #4
Once you have the Jupyter Notebook for this assignment open, then follow the istructions described therein. 

# Jupyter Notebooks
If you haven't used Jupyter Notebooks before, a good first step for you would be to read the [Jupyter Notebook Tutorial: The Definitive Guide](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook) and take the User Interface Tour in the Jupyter notebook Help menu once you've opened your first Jupyter Notebook.
